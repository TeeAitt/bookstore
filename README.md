Bookstore practice project

In this project I am developing a database with Java, JPA, H2 and Thymeleaf.

This is a practice project, that I am doing in our schools Server Programming course.
As said it's intended to be an exercise that is extended with new functions etc. as the course goes forward.

Currently it has:
 - the bookstore mainpage, where all the books are listed
 - a page for adding new books
 - a page for editing an existin book
 - a page where new categories can be added

Functions for all mentioned above and also a function for deleting a book.

It is also a relational database: there are two Classes, Book and Category, with a many-to-one and one-to-many relationship.

It now also has RESTful services, so books and categories can now be used with JSON.
